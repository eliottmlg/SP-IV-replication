The Sticky Price Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated from a                                                               2024-12-11       Current
subset of goods and services included in the CPI that change price
relatively infrequently. Because these goods and services change price
relatively infrequently, they are thought to incorporate expectations
about future inflation to a greater degree than prices that change on
a more frequent basis. One possible explanation for sticky prices
could be the costs firms incur when changing price.  To obtain more
